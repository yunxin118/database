### Healthcare Appointment Management System
This system is designed to streamline healthcare appointment management by allowing users to create, view, and delete appointments in a structured way. It includes three primary entities: Patients, Doctors, and Appointments.
#### Key Features:
1. CRUD Operations: Users can create, read, update, and delete records for patients, doctors, and appointments.
2. Appointment Scheduling: Allows users to schedule appointments with specific doctors based on specialization and availability.
3. Data Relationships: Patients and doctors are connected through appointment records, and each appointment includes details like diagnosis, appointment date, and doctor specialization.
4. SQL Joins: The system utilizes SQL joins to combine data from multiple tables, providing a comprehensive view of appointment information.
